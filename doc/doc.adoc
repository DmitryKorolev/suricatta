Introduction
------------

_suricatta_ is a high level sql toolkit for clojure (backed by fantastic
link:http://www.jooq.org/[jooq library])

It consists in three modules:

- sql executor: jdbc abstraction layer for executing queries.
- sql builder: lightweight dsl for idiomatic sql building.
- sql formatter: sql rendering utils.


Use cases
~~~~~~~~~

The _suricatta_ library is very flexible and it can be used in very different ways:

- You can build queries with _suricatta_ and execute them with _clojure.jdbc_.
- You can use _suricatta_ for executing queries with string-based sql.
- You can combine the _suricatta_ library with _clojure.jdbc_.
- And obviously, you can forget jdbc and use _suricatta_ for both purposes, building and/or
  executing queries.


Project Maturity
----------------

_suricatta_ is considered in alpha state.

Since _suricatta_ is a young project there may be some API breakage.


Install
-------

This section covers the _suricatta_ library installing process and its requirements.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

_suricatta_ is tested with these platforms:

- JDK7
- JDK8


Leiningen
~~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to use _suricatta_ in a clojure project, is by including it in the dependency
vector on your *_project.clj_* file:

._on project.clj_
[source,clojure]
----
[suricatta "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
----


Gradle
~~~~~~

If you are using gradle, this is a dependency line for gradle dsl:

[source,groovy]
----
compile "suricatta:suricatta:0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
----


Maven
~~~~~

If you are using maven:

.Repository entry.
[source,xml]
----

SQL Execution
-------------

This section intends to explain the usage of a sql execution part of the library.


Connecting to database
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_suricatta_, unlike other database libraries, uses a concept of *context instead of *connection*.
A **context** has the resposibility of jdbc connection resource management, transaction isolation
flags and sql rendering dialect.

You can create it **context** from:

- Plain jdbc connection.
- link:http://niwibe.github.io/clojure.jdbc[clojure.jdbc] connection object
- hash-map dbspec format (same format as in _clojure.jdbc_)

The use of link:http://niwibe.github.io/clojure.jdbc[clojure.jdbc] allows to _suricatta_ have good
support for datasource (link:http://niwibe.github.io/clojure.jdbc/#connection-pool[connection pool]) dbspec's.

Let see some examples:

.Creating context from _dbspec_
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[suricatta.core :as sc])

(with-open [ctx (sc/context {:subprotocol "h2"
                             :subname "mem:"})]
  (do-something-with ctx))
----

.Create context from existing _clojure.jdbc_ connection.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[jdbc.core :as jdbc])
(require '[suricatta.core :as sc])

(def dbspec {:subprotocol "h2"
             :subname "mem:"})

(jdbc/with-connection [conn dbspec]
  (let [ctx (sc/context conn)
        res (do-something ctx)]
    res))
----

.Create context from dbspec with datasource (connection pool).
[source, clojure]
----
;; Import the desired implementation
(require '[jdbc.pool.dbcp :as pool])

(def dbspec (pool/make-datasource-spec {:classname "org.postgresql.Driver"
                                        :subprotocol "postgresql"
                                        :subname "//localhost:5432/dbname"}))

(with-open [ctx (sc/context dbspec)]
  (do-something-with ctx))
----


Executing queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

_suricatta_ has clear separation between queries that can return result, and queries that cannot.

.Example using `suricatta.core/execute` function.
[source, clojure]
----
(require '[suricatta.core :as sc])
(sc/execute ctx "CREATE TABLE foo")
----

The return value of `suricatta.core/execute` function depends on the query.


Fetching results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let see an example of how execute a query and fetch results:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[suricatta.core :as sc])
(sc/fetch ctx "select x from generate_series(1,3) as x")
;; => [{:x 1} {:x 2} {:x 3}]
----

[NOTE]
====
_suricatta_ gives you the power of use the raw sql queries without
any restrictions (unlike jdbc). As great example, _suricatta_ does
not have special syntax for queries with `RETURNING` clause:

[source, clojure]
----
(sc/fetch ctx "INSERT INTO foo (name) values ('bar') returning id")
;; => [{:id 27}]
----
====


Parametrized queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Like _clojure.jdbc_ and _clojure.java.jdbc_, _suricatta_ has support for parametrized
queries in *sqlvec* format.

[source, clojure]
----
(sc/fetch ctx ["select id from books where age > ? limit 1" 100])
;; => [{:id 4232}]
----


Reusing query statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The above technique can be quite useful when you want to reuse expensive database resources.

[source, clojure]
----
(with-open [q (sc/query ctx ["select ?" 1])]
  (sc/fetch q)  ;; Creates a statement
  (sc/fetch q)) ;; Reuses the previous created statement
----


Transactions
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _suricatta_ library does not have support for low level transactions api, instead of it, offers a
lightweight abstraction over complex transaction api.

.Execute a query in a transaction block.
[source, clojure]
----
(sc/atomic-apply ctx (fn [ctx]
                       (sc/fetch ctx "select id, name from book for update")))
----

Additionally to `atomic-apply` high order functiom, _suricatta_ comes with convenient macro offering
lightweight sugar sytax for atomic blocks:

.Execute a query in a transaction block using sugar syntax macro.
[source, clojure]
----
(cs/atomic ctx
  (sc/fetch ctx "select id, name from book for update"))
----

You can nest atomic usage as deep as you want, subtransactions are fully supported.

If a exception is raised inside atomic context the transaction will be aborted. Also, in
some circumstances, you probable want an explicit rollback, for it, the _suricatta_ library
exposes a `suricatta.core/set-rollback!` function.

.Explicit rollback example
[source, clojure]
----
(cs/atomic ctx
  (sc/execute ctx "update table1 set f1 = 1")
  (sc/set-rollback! ctx))
----

The `set-rollback!` function only marks the current transaction for rollback. It not aborts
the execution. And it is aware of subtransactions, if it is used in a subtransaction, only
the subtransaction will be marked for rollback, not the entire transaction.


Lazy result fetching
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The _suricatta_ library also comes with lazy fetching support. In this case, it tries instead
of fetching all results in memory, fetch in small groups, allowing lower memory usage.

Lazy fetching has few quirks:

- It some databases it requires run in one transaction, like _PostgreSQL_, because it uses a server
  side cursors for make it possible.
- Requires explicit resource management, because for make possible lazy fetching, a connection and
  internal resultset should be mantained open until fetching is finished.

To use lazy fetch is realy easy, because suricatta exposes it like simple lazy sequence. Let
see one example:

.Example executing large query and fetching elemens in groups of 10.
[source, clojure]
----
(def sql "SELECT x FROM generate_series(1, 10000)")

(cs/atomic ctx
  (with-open [cursor (sc/fetch-lazy ctx sql {:fetch-size 10})]
    (doseq [item (sc/cursor->lazyseq cursor)]
      (println item))))

;; This should print something similar to:
;; {:x 1}
;; {:x 2}
;; ...
----

The third parameter of `sc/fetch-lazy` function is optional and the default fetch size
currently has value of 100.


Batch execution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not implemented yet.


Async interface
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is well known that jdbc does not support proper way handle queries in asynchronous manner. But
exists also a well known way to handle with it: using a shared thread pool for execute queries
asynchronously.

Also, clojure comes with good abstractions for execute things asynchronously: agents. Agents
in clojure uses a shared execution pool and guarantes that things are executed serially.

The _suricatta_ library takes advantage of that, and exposes a simple async api using
_core.async_ channels abstraction and link:https://github.com/niwibe/cats[cats library] for
error handling (error as value).

Let start importing necessary namespaces:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[clojure.core.async :refer [go <! into]])
(require '[suricatta.async :as sca])
(require '[cats.monad.exception :as exc])
----

You can found that the functions found on async namespace (`execute` and `fetch`)
are almost identical that ones form `suricatta.core` (previously explained). The
main difference is that them returns _core.async_ channels.

.Example executing a query using async interface.
[source, clojure]
----
(go
  (with-open [ctx (sc/context dbspec)]
    (let [sql    "insert into foo (n) values (1), (2)"
          result (<! (sca/execute ctx sql))]
      result)))
----

.Example fetching results from query using async interface.
[source, clojure]
----
(go
  (with-open [ctx (sc/context dbspec)]
    (let [sql    "select * from foo order by n"
          ch     (sca/fetch ctx sql)]
      (<! (into [] ch)))))
----


SQL Building and Formatting
---------------------------

This section intends to explain the usage of sql building library, the lightweight layer on
top of `jooq` dsl.

You can found all related functions of sql dsl on `suricatta.dsl` namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[suricatta.dsl :as dsl])
----

And functions related to formating sql into string or sqlvec format in `suricatta.format` namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(require '[suricatta.format :as fmt])
----

The SELECT statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Select clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple select clause without from part:

[source, clojure]
----
(dsl/select :id :name)
----

Would generate SQL like this:

[source,sql]
----
select id, name from dual
----

The rendering result depends of used dialect. You can specify an other dialect
passing `:dialect` option to `get-sql` function of `suricatta.format` namespace:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :id :name)
    (fmt/get-sql {:dialect :postgresql}))
;; => "select id, name"
----


Select DISTINCT
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add distinct keyword using special select function:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select-distinct :name)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select distinct name"
----


Select *
^^^^^^^^

You can ommit fields on `select` function for use the "SELECT *" form:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select * from book"
----


The FROM clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Simple select sql with form clause:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :book.id :book.name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select book.id, book.name from book"
----

Also, sql form clause supports specify any number of tables:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select-one)
    (dsl/from :book :article)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select 1 from book, article"
----

Also, you can specify alias for each table:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select-one)
    (dsl/from (dsl/table "book" :alias "a")
              (dsl/table "article" :alias "b"))
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select 1 from book \"a\", article \"b\""
----


The JOIN clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

_suricata_ comes with complete dsl for making join clauses. Let see one simple example:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/join :author)
    (dsl/on "book.author_id = book.id")
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book join author on (book.author_id = book.id)"
----

Also, join clause can be applied to table expression:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from (-> (dsl/table "book")
                  (dsl/join "author")
                  (dsl/on "book.author_id = book.id")))
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book join author on (book.author_id = book.id)"
----


The WHERE clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The WHERE clause can be used for JOIN or filter predicates, in order to restrict the data returned
by the query:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/where "book.age > 100")
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book where (book.age > 100)"
----

Build where clause with multiple conditions:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/where "book.age > 100"
               "book.in_store = true")
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book where ((book.age > 100) and (book.in_store = true))"
----


Bind parameters instead of inline them on conditions:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/where ["book.age > ?" 100]
               ["book.in_store = ?", true])
    (fmt/sqlvec))
;; => ["select name from book where ((book.age > ?) and (book.in_store = ?))" 100 true]
----

Using explicit logical operators:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/where (dsl/or "book.age > 20"
                       (dsl/not "book.in_store")))
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book where ((book.age > 20) or (not book.in_store))"
----


The GROUP BY clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

GROUP BY can be used to create unique groups of data, to form aggregations, to remove duplicates and for other reasons. Let see an example of how it can be done using _suricatta_ dsl:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select (dsl/field "name")
                (dsl/field "count(*)"))
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/group-by :name)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name, count(*) from book group by name"
----


The HAVING clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The HAVING clause is used to further restrict aggregated data. Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select (dsl/field "name")
                (dsl/field "count(*)"))
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/group-by :name)
    (dsl/having ["count(*) > ?", 2])
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name, count(*) from book group by name having (count(*) > ?)"
----

The ORDER BY clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Here an example of how specify the ordering to the query:

.Ordering by field with implicit sort direction
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/order-by :name)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book order by name asc"
----

In previous example we have specified order field without order direction, _surricata_ automatically
uses `ASC` for sort fields that comes without explicit ordering direction.

.Specify sort direction explicitly
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/order-by [:name :desc])
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book order by name desc"
----

.Handling nulls
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/order-by [:name :desc :nulls-last])
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book order by name desc nulls last"
----

.Ordering by index
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :id :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/order-by ["1" :asc]
                  ["2" :desc])
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book order by 1 asc, 2 desc"
----


The LIMIT and OFFSET clauses
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Let see some examples of how to apply limit and offset to your queries with _suricatta_:

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select :id :name)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/limit 10)
    (dsl/offset 100)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select name from book limit ? offset ?"
----


The FOR UPDATE clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For inter-process synchronisation and other reasons, you may choose to use the SELECT .. FOR UPDATE
clause to indicate to the database, that a set of cells or records should be locked by a
given transaction for subsequent updates. Let see an example of how use it with _suricatta_ dsl:

.Without specific fields
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/for-update)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select * from book for update"
----

.With specific fields
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/select)
    (dsl/from :book)
    (dsl/for-update :name)
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "select * from book for update of \"name\""
----

The UNION and UNION ALL clause
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These operators combine two results into one. UNION removes all duplicate records resulting from this combination and UNION ALL preserves all results as they are.

.Using UNION clause
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/union
    (-> (dsl/select :name)
        (dsl/from :books))
    (-> (dsl/select :name)
        (dsl/from :articles)))
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "(select name from books) union (select name from articles)"
----

.Using UNION ALL clause
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/union-all
    (-> (dsl/select :name)
        (dsl/from :books))
    (-> (dsl/select :name)
        (dsl/from :articles)))
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "(select name from books) union all (select name from articles)"
----


The INSERT statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The INSERT statement is used to insert new records into a database table.

.Example of insert two rows in one table.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/insert-into :table1)
    (dsl/insert-values {:f1 1 :f2 2 :f3 3})
    (dsl/insert-values {:f1 4 :f2 5 :f3 6})
    (fmt/sqlvec))
;; => ["insert into t1 (f1, f2, f3) values (?, ?, ?), (?, ?, ?)" 1 2 3 4 5 6]
----


The UPDATE statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The UPDATE statement is used to modify one or several pre-existing records in a database table.

.Example of update statement without condition.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set :name "foo")
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "update t1 set name = ?"
----

.Example of update statement without condition using a map
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set {:name "foo" :bar "baz"})
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "update t1 set name = ?, bar = ?"
----

.Example of update statement with one condition.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set :name "foo")
    (dsl/where ["id = ?" 1])
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "update t1 set name = ? where (id = ?)"
----

.Example of update statement using subquery.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set :f1 (-> (dsl/select :f2)
                     (dsl/from :t2)
                     (dsl/where ["id = ?" 2])))
    (fmt/get-sql {:dialect :pgsql}))
;; => "update t1 set f1 = (select f2 from t2 where (id = ?))"
----

.Example of multiple assignation un update statement using subquery.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set (dsl/row (dsl/field :f1)
                      (dsl/field :f2))
             (-> (dsl/select :f3 :f4)
                 (dsl/from :t2)
                 (dsl/where ["id = ?" 2])))
    (fmt/get-sql {:dialect :pgsql}))
;; => "update t1 set (f1, f2) = (select f3, f4 from t2 where (id = ?))"
----

.Example of returning clause used in UPDATE statement.
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/update :t1)
    (dsl/set :name "foo")
    (dsl/returning :id)
    (fmt/get-sql {:dialect :pgsql}))
;; => "update t1 set name = ? returning id"
----


The DELETE statement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.Simple example of delete statement with one condition
[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/delete :t1)
    (dsl/where "id = 1")
    (fmt/get-sql))
;; => "delete from t1 where (id = 1)"
----


SQL Statements (DDL)

[source, clojure]
----
(-> (dsl/truncate :table1)
    (fmt/get-sql))

    (dsl/from (-> (dsl/values (dsl/row 1 2)
                              (dsl/row 3 4))
                  (dsl/as "t1" "f1" "f2")))
    (fmt/get-sql {:type :inlined}))
;; => "select f1, f2 from (values(1, 2), (3, 4)) as \"t1\" (\"f1\", \"f2\")"
----

WARNING: `suricatta.dsl/row` is defined as macro and only accept literals.

Nested SELECTs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.Using nested select in where clause
[source, clojure]

Executing queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Almost all method in *dsl* always returns some kind of *deferred* object. That object implements
needed protocos for make them compatible with `suricatta.core/execute` and `suricatta.core/fetch`
functions.

Let see an example:

[source, clojure]
----
(def my-query
  (-> (dsl/select :id)
      (dsl/from :books)
      (dsl/where ["age > ?", 100])
      (dsl/limit 1)))

(with-open [ctx (sc/context dbspec)]
  (sc/fetch ctx my-query))
;; => [{:id 4232}]

FAQ
---

Why I should use suricatta instead of clojure.jdbc or java.jdbc?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike any jdbc library, _suricatta_ works in slightly higher level. It hides a lot of
idiosyncrasies of jdbc under much *simpler, cleaner and less error prone api*, with better
resource management.


Why an other dsl? Is yet another?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In first instance _suricatta_ is not a dsl library, is a sql toolkit, and one part of the
toolkit is a dsl.

Secondly, _suricatta_'s dsl don't intends to be a sql abstraction. The real purpose of
_suricatta_'s dsl is make SQL composable, allowing use all or almost all vendor specific
sql constructions.


Is a korma-clone?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not, is not korma clone. Because it works very different, and it has different philosophy.

_suricatta_ has cleaner differentiation between dsl and query execution/fetching. It not intends
to be a replacement of Korma. It intends be a replacement to raw jdbc access to the database.


Is required buy JOOQ comercial license?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not, _suricatta_ works and tested with opensource (Apache 2.0 licensed) version of JOOQ.

I have plans to make _suricatta_ work with enterprise version of JOOQ for users that want use
"enterprise" databases in a future. In any case, that will not affect the open source version.


Can I store safely queries builded by DSL in a var, they are immutable?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yes. Unlike JOOQ DSL interface that has mutable api, _suricatta_ exposes immutable
api for building queries.

Queries builded by _suricatta_ can be safely shared through different threads.


How to Contribute?

Philosophy
~~~~~~~~~~

Five most important rules:

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Readability counts.

All contributions to _suricatta_ should keep these important rules in mind.
